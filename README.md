üöÄ C++ Basics: Array & String Exercises
Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of simple C++ programs demonstrating fundamental operations on arrays and strings. Each file is a standalone exercise, perfect for anyone starting their journey with C++ or looking to brush up on the basics.

üß† Fundamental Concepts
Before diving into the code, let's quickly review the two core data structures used in this repository.

What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Think of it like a row of numbered mailboxes, where each box holds one item, and you can access any item directly by knowing its box number (which is called its index). In C++, array indices start at 0.

What is a String?
A string is essentially a sequence of characters. You can think of it as an array of characters, like the letters that make up a word or a sentence. In modern C++, the std::string class is used to handle strings, making them very easy to work with.

üìÇ What's Inside?
This collection provides hands-on examples for a variety of common tasks, split into two main categories.

Array Operations üî¢
exp7a.cc: Basic array initialization and display.

exp7b (1).cc: Linear search to find an element in an array.

exp7c (1).cc: Reversing an array's elements in-place.

exp7d.cc: Calculating the sum and average of array elements.

String Operations ‚úçÔ∏è
exp7f.cc: Simple user input and output for strings.

exp7g.cc: Concatenating (joining) two strings.

exp7h.cc: Reversing a string.

exp7i.cc: Checking if a string is a palindrome.

üíª Code Explanations
Here is a summary of what each file does and the logic behind it.

File Name	Purpose	Core Logic
exp7a.cc	Array Initialization & Display	Creates a fixed-size array, prompts the user to fill it, and then prints the contents.
exp7b (1).cc	Search in Array	Implements a linear search to find a number's index in a user-defined array.
exp7c (1).cc	Reverse an Array	Reverses an array in-place using a two-pointer (start and end) swapping method.
exp7d.cc	Sum & Average of Array	Calculates the sum of all array elements and then computes their average.
exp7f.cc	Basic String Input	A simple program to accept a string from the user and display it back.
exp7g.cc	String Concatenation	Joins two separate strings, provided by the user, into one using the + operator.
exp7h.cc	Reverse a String	Reverses a hardcoded string by iterating through it backward, from the last character to the first.
exp7i.cc	Palindrome Check	Determines if a string is a palindrome by comparing corresponding characters from each end.
